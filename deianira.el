Upon match, the string segment it matched is always two characters long.

Beware that if there's a named function key <ns-drag-n-drop>, it
will match against s- in the ns- there.  To guard this, use
`dei--modifier-regexp-safe', although that has its own flaws.")

Benefit: it will always match if there's at least one modifier,
and not count spurious modifier-looking things such as
<ns-drag-n-drop> which contains an \"s-\".

Drawback: you can't match twice on the same string.  Look at the
case of M-s-<down>: it'll match M-, but if the search continues
from there, it will fail to match s- since it's only looking for
s- preceded by a dash (i.e. \"-s-\"), and our second search
starts past the first dash.  However, it's fine if you cut the
string and start a new search on the cut string.")

This means that the behavior of a perma-chorded sequence such as
C-x¬†C-k C-e will be kept as is, and cloned to the chord-once
sequence C-x¬†k e, overwriting any binding there, so they both do
what the former always did.  If the setting is nil, both will
instead do what C-x¬†k e always did.

PLEASE NOTE that any calls to `define-key' in your initfiles have
to take this into account!  If this is t, all sequences have to
be written in perma-chord style to be sure the choice sticks.  If
this is nil, they have to be written in the chord-once style to
be sure the choice sticks.  (Of course, you can always bind both
while you experiment with this setting.)  For this reason, the setting

specific cases in `dei-flatten-winners', and if only one is bound
