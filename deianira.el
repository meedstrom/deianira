(defconst dei--modifier-regexp

  "Regexp for any of the modifiers: \"C-\", \"M-\" etc.
Upon match, the string segment it matched is always two characters long.

Beware that if there's a named function key <ns-drag-n-drop>, it
will match against s- in the ns- there.  To guard this, use
`dei--modifier-regexp-safe', although that has its own flaws.")

(defconst dei--modifier-regexp-safe
  (rx (or "<" "-" bol space)
      (regexp (regexp-opt '("A-" "C-" "H-" "M-" "S-" "s-"))))
  "Like `dei--modifier-regexp', but check a preceding character.
Benefit: it will always match if there's at least one modifier,
and not count spurious modifier-looking things such as
<ns-drag-n-drop> which contains an \"s-\".

Drawback: you can't match twice on the same string.  Look at the
case of M-s-<down>: it'll match M-, but if the search continues
from there, it will fail to match s- since it's only looking for
s- preceded by a dash (i.e. \"-s-\"), and our second search
starts past the first dash.  However, it's fine if you cut the
string and start a new search on the cut string.")

This means that the behavior of a perma-chorded sequence such as
C-x¬†C-k C-e will be kept as is, and cloned to the chord-once
sequence C-x¬†k e, overwriting any binding there, so they both do
what the former always did.  If the setting is nil, both will
instead do what C-x¬†k e always did.

PLEASE NOTE that any calls to `define-key' in your initfiles have
to take this into account!  If this is t, all sequences have to
be written in perma-chord style to be sure the choice sticks.  If
this is nil, they have to be written in the chord-once style to
be sure the choice sticks.  (Of course, you can always bind both
while you experiment with this setting.)

This variable sets the default approach, but you can override
specific cases in `dei-homogenizing-winners'; and if only one
variety is bound but not the other, the binding will be cloned no
