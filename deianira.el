(defconst dei--modifier-regexp
  (regexp-opt '("A-" "C-" "H-" "M-" "S-" "s-"))
  "Regexp for any of the modifiers: \"C-\", \"M-\" etc.
Upon match, the string segment it matched is always two characters long.

Beware that if there's a named function key <ns-drag-n-drop>, it
will match against s- in the ns- there.  To guard this, use
`dei--modifier-regexp-safe', although that has its own flaws.")

(defconst dei--modifier-regexp-safe
  (rx (or "<" "-" bol " ")
      (or "A-" "C-" "H-" "M-" "S-" "s-"))
  "Like `dei--modifier-regexp', but check a preceding character.
Benefit: it will always match if there's at least one modifier,
and not count spurious modifier-looking things such as
<ns-drag-n-drop> which contains an \"s-\".

Drawback: you can't match twice on the same string.  Look at the
case of M-s-<down>: it'll match M-, but if the search continues
from there, it will fail to match s- since it's only looking for
s- preceded by a dash (i.e. \"-s-\"), and our second search
starts past the first dash.  However, it's fine if you cut the
string and start a new search on the cut string.")

This means that the behavior of a perma-chorded sequence such as
C-x¬†C-k C-e will be kept as is, and cloned to the chord-once
sequence C-x¬†k e, overwriting any binding there, so they both do
what the former always did.  If the setting is nil, both will
instead do what C-x¬†k e always did.

PLEASE NOTE that any calls to `define-key' or similar in your
initfiles have to take this into account!  If this is t, all
sequences have to be written in perma-chord style to be sure the
choice sticks.  If this is nil, they have to be written in the
chord-once style to be sure the choice sticks.  (Of course, you
can always bind both while you experiment with this setting.)

This variable sets the default approach, but you can override
specific cases in `dei-homogenizing-winners'; and if only one

This has to do with e.g. C-x \[ becoming C-x C-\[, which is the

this, then Magit tries to bind C-x M-g and complains it's not a
prefix key and you can't even load Magit.  That's mild issue.  A
more silent bug is C-x i becoming C-x C-i which goes ahead and
overrides your C-x TAB binding without signaling anything even to
the developer.

The problem is that control characters should be deprecated.  I
recommend a solution like `dei-define-super-like-ctl-everywhere' and
never typing another control character.

If you don't, it pays to know to always bind <tab> instead of
TAB, <return> instead of RET, and <escape> instead of ESC.  GUI
Emacs always looks up these if bound, and only falls back to the
control character if these function keys are unbound.  They do
not work on the terminal/TTY, but neither does Super or many
