May also interest people looking to break with ESC behaving like
a sticky Meta.  ESC isn't a sticky Alt, so you could safely
re-bind it.  The benefit is unclear though: you'd be able to use
ESC as another function key in the TTY, but you'd have to set up
the console to emit Alt codes instead of Meta to benefit, and a

F13 in place of ESC, which seems easier."

;;; Homogenizing

(defcustom dei-homogenizing-winners '()
  "Alist of keys that always win the homogenizing battle.
Normally, the behavior of a chord-once sequence such as C-x¬†k¬†e
will be kept as is, and cloned to the perma-chord sequence
C-x¬†C-k¬†C-e, overwriting any binding there, so they both do what
the former always did.

If this list contains the member (\"C-x C-k C-e\"), the opposite
will happen in that particular case, overwriting C-x¬†k¬†e.

Each item in the list has the format (KEY-OR-COMMAND . KEYMAP).
See the package readme for how a full list may look.

KEY-OR-COMMAND can be either a `kbd'-compatible key description
or a symbol assumed to refer to a command.  In the event that you
add e.g.¬†both (\"C-x¬†C-f\") and (set-fill-column -- normally a
binding of C-x¬†f -- to the list, then the first item wins.
If (\"C-x C-f\") was first, then C-x¬†f will be bound to find-file.

If KEYMAP is nil, make KEY-OR-COMMAND win in whichever keymap
where it is found.  If non-nil, KEYMAP should be a major or minor
mode map.  It will likely have no effect if it is a so-called
named prefix command such as Control-X-prefix or
kmacro-keymap (you can find these with `describe-function',
whereas you can't find org-mode-map, as that's a proper mode
map)."

Magit.  That's a mild issue.  A more silent bug is C-x¬†i becoming
C-x¬†C-i which means it overrides your C-x¬†TAB binding, something
you're blissfully unaware of until you try to use C-x¬†TAB.

The root problem is anachronistic Unix control character
behavior, which Emacs has chosen not to deprecate, for the sake
of functioning inside basic terminal emulators, TTYs and ssh
connections.  We have a clean solution in
`dei-define-super-like-ctl-everywhere' and never typing another
control character in your life.  Alternatively, we have an
untested partial solution in `dei--protect-ret-and-tab'.

If you don't apply the solution, it pays to know this: always
bind the function key <tab> instead of the control character TAB,
<return> instead of RET, <escape> instead of ESC, <linefeed>
instead of LFD, <backspace> instead of DEL, and <delete> instead
of BS.  GUI Emacs always looks up the function key if bound, and
only falls back to the control character if the function key is
unbound.  The function keys may not work on the terminal/TTY, but
neither do Super, Hyper or many other niceties, and I recommend
just using chemacs to run a barebone Emacs for the odd time
you're on the TTY.

While it is possible to rescue C-i and C-m from the cold dead
hands of Unix, you cannot ever use C-\[ as anything other than an
ESC shorthand.  As for C-g, the problem isn't Unix, only a
hardcoded default in Emacs, and I deem it's not fully rescuable
without a patchset that lets you decide via a command-line flag
or Xresource, which key should act as keyboard-quit instead of
C-g.

To sum up, we return non-nil if the key sequence starts with
Control and involves any of \[, m, i, or g anywhere in the
sequence.  So even the sequence C-h¬†g is a nightmare key:
homogenizing it means binding C-h¬†C-g to the same, creating a
situation when C-g is not available to do `keyboard-quit'."
